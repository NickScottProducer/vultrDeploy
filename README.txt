Requires Python 3

Allocate your vultr API token in one step here:

https://my.vultr.com/settings/#settingsapi

INSTRUCTIONS:

Run the "startupScriptCreator(RUN THIS PROGRAM FIRST).py" file first


Then run the "vultrDeploy.py" file

You only need to run startupScriptCreator once, unless ur washed

TROUBLESHOOT:

-If it seems like the servers aren't destroying, it's because vultr makes you wait 5 minutes before you can destroy a server from the time you deploy it.
-If you go to write the proxy text file and some show up as "0.0.0.0:3128..." ect. -- wait about 10 seconds and try again. It takes a few seconds for the servers to actually generate a public IP.
